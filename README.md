# azndark-test
Site currently deployed on the test server.

The project was born from my idea to create a website for AznDarkProduction,
the team of a youtuber named Darkheaven, found on YouTube and Twitch under
the name of his team.

The purpose of this site is to give a better visibility, description of what
he does and access to the different series he plays as well as to his
different social networks.

Other features, new ones will come later. All suggestions are also
welcome. You can send them to this email address: suggestion@thelightguardian.fr
